A small test for front-end Javascript Developer candidates

## Overview

Please spend up to 2 hours on this coding challenge. Note that we don't expect you to complete everything listed in the requirements. We have included more than 2 hours worth of work to allow you to still complete some parts if you get stuck. We prefer you to provide less code that is well structured and well tested than more code which is badly structured and has bugs.

Please submit your finished code as a public git repo and please make regular commits so we can understand more easily how you came to your solution. In your readme file, please include: 

- any instructions to run the code
- what you have done in the coding challenge
- any further improvements you could make
- any problems you faced

If you have any questions about the coding challenge, please contact recruitment@pimberly.com
